;; Exercise 2.43.  Louis Reasoner is having a terrible time doing
;; exercise 2.42. His queens procedure seems to work, but it runs
;; extremely slowly. (Louis never does manage to wait long enough for
;; it to solve even the 6× 6 case.) When Louis asks Eva Lu Ator for
;; help, she points out that he has interchanged the order of the
;; nested mappings in the flatmap, writing it as

(flatmap
 (lambda (new-row)
   (map (lambda (rest-of-queens)
          (adjoin-position new-row k rest-of-queens))
        (queen-cols (- k 1))))
 (enumerate-interval 1 board-size))

;; Explain why this interchange makes the program run slowly. Estimate
;; how long it will take Louis's program to solve the eight-queens
;; puzzle, assuming that the program in exercise 2.42 solves the
;; puzzle in time T.
